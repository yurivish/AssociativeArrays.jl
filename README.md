# Associative Arrays

This package implements associative arrays, the mathematical objects introduced in the book [Mathematics of Big Data](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mathematics-big-data).

This is currently a proof of concept. Much more to do.

**Note:** This package should not be used by anybody for anything; it is an experiment created during a course I took with the author of said book.
